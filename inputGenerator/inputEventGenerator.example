# Example of input file for generator:

0.2                 hscale      # Height scale of the simulation (kpc)
8.33                rSun        # Solar radius (kpc)
2                   width       # Width of the solar circle (kpc)
3                   rd          # Radius scale for galaxy mass distribution (kpc)
7000                time        # Simulation time (Myr)
5                   r0          # Present-time galactic event rate (n/Myr)
10                  sampleDt    # How often to sample the simulation (Myr)
100                 nRuns       # Number of runs for the monte carlo method
wanderman           rateFunct   # Rate function. Choices are: linear, constant, hopkins, wanderman, cucciatiInterpol, cucciatiPolyfit and cucciatiStep
